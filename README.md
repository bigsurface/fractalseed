Fractalseed: Recursive Fractal Generation Framework

Fractalseed is an open-source project dedicated to generating and exploring recursive fractal patterns influenced by the J-Recursive Fractal License (J-RFL v1.0). This framework allows users to delve into the intricacies of fractal geometry, offering tools for both visualization and analysis.

Features
  - Recursive Fractal Generation: Create complex fractal patterns with customizable parameters.
  - Visualization Tools: Interactive modules to visualize fractals in real-time.
  - Modular Architecture: Easily extendable components for adding new fractal types or functionalities.
  - Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Installation

To set up Fractalseed on your local machine:
  1. Clone the Repository:
       git clone --recursive https://github.com/bigsurface/fractalseed.git
  2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
       cd fractalseed
  3. Install Dependencies:
       Using pip:
         pip install -r requirements.txt
      Using conda:
         conda env create -f environment.yml

Usage

After installation, you can start generating fractals:
  1. Basic Fractal Generation:
     python generate_fractal.py --type mandelbrot --iterations 1000
  2. Accessing the GUI:
     python app.py
     This command launches the interactive visualization tool.
